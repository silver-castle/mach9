## Pull requests

So the pull request approval rules are pretty simple:
1. All pull requests must pass unit tests.
2. All pull requests must have explicit value for maintainers.
3. All pull requests must pass flake8 checks.
4. All pull requests must be consistent with the existing code.
5. If you implement a new feature you should have at least one unit
test to accompany it.

## Warning

Mach9 gives priority to go ahead and keep simple and small.  
A pull request which does not have explicit value for maintainers may not be merged.  
A pull request which is not understood by maintainers may not be merged.  
Please don't let this intimidate you!
